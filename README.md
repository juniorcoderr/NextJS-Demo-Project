### 📢 Disclaimer  
🚀 This project was built **only for learning purposes** and is not intended for production use. It is a demonstration of Next.js capabilities, including image handling with Cloudinary and user interaction features like liking and disliking posts.  

In this project, I also **learned about mutating data** in a Next.js application, including handling **user-generated content, updating UI state dynamically.**  

This repository does not implement security best practices, authentication, or data validation required for a real-world application. If you plan to use similar functionality in a live environment, it is strongly recommended to implement **proper authentication, authorization, validation, and security measures** to protect user data and ensure system integrity.  

Additionally, since images are stored on Cloudinary, make sure to **review Cloudinary's usage policies** if deploying a similar system at scale.  

**Use this code as a reference or starting point, but not as a production-ready application.** Happy coding! 🚀
